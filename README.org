* Requirements
- Upload fresh bank transactions to YNAB
- Supported banks: OP, Spankki
- Should be stateless
- Runs a command (with appeal https://github.com/larryhastings/appeal) (can be used in cron):
   Params:
   - YNAB auth token
   - YNAB budget_id
   - YNAB account_id 
   - secrets from GoCardless
   - account_id / name of the bank insitution to upload
   - transactions time range
- Command should report number of imported and duplicated transactions
- Nice to have:
  - command that build authorization link (might be needed every 3 months)
  - command that provide budget_id/account_id information (list of available with name)

    
* TODOs
- [X] MVP 
- [ ] end-to-end testing based on results of MVP
- [ ] refactor API classes
- [ ] separate cli from logic
- [ ] add usefull commands (building links, getting GoCardless and YNAB account/budget information)
